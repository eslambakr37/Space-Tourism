## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size (1440px - 1360px - 768px - 375px).
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library v18.2.0

### What I learned

I exploited this project to learn React architecture and I developed this project using the function components method. Also, I used some hooks like useState and useEffect in addition to some methods  from the react-router-dom library such as  Routes, Route, Navigate and useLocation method.


### Continued development

I will learn more about React hooks and I'm looking forward to building the next project which should be able to handle APIs requests using the React library.
